This repository contains code for an interface for testing for
functional redundancy between a set of species within an ecosystem using
the Diversity-Interactions models (DI; [Kirwan et al.,
2009](https://doi.org/10.1890/08-1684.1)) framework. Open the .R code
file for viewing the code for the interface and examples of using it.
